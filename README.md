# Team-Tree-Go

## Description
Team-Tree-Go is a simple app designed for tracking and organizing members of a team through mysql based relationships. It is useful for quickly referencing various data points through queries via the Inquirer npm. I used the console-table-printer library instead of the console.table() method to display information b/c all the green of the console.table was hurting my eyes...
